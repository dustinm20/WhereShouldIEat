Lunch picker (suggested implementation: CLI, web or mobile app). If you’re a working software engineer, you’ve probably wrestled with one of the toughest questions in software development… where should I have lunch? Your lunch picker is the tool you’ll turn to to answer this question. It can be super simple and pick from a range of options you know you like at random, or more complex — pulling in data from Google Reviews and taking into account: location, price, and type of cuisine.
